                        The sun is out. The mustache is fuller than ever. You just heard on the radio from your Ferrari 308 GTS that chest hair is back in. You feel good about yourself and the seemingly endless arsenal of Hawaiian shirts you have hanging in your closet. Your butler has taken care of the dishes. The car is waxed and ready to spin. <br> <br>
                        With nothing to do but wile away the hours on the beach, watching the sunset over a peaceful horizon as the sea birds serenade the ending of another perfect day. <br> <br>

                        You're not digging around in the couch cushions for change-type broke, but you want to leave enough cheddar in the bank for as many margaritas as you or your 'summer company' can drink.

                        <p>If you’re looking to put aside a bit of money in anticipation of your Ferrari’s upcoming service cost - which, given how fast you drive it around the winding roads of Hawaii, is likely to be a pretty penny. Perhaps the entry-level option on this list is the one for you. From Invicta comes the Pro Diver automatic black dial Pepsi bezel Men’s watch, for under $100, thanks to the humongous, 80% discount (down from $495) available currently on Jomashop.com.

                            From a distance, the Invicta can pull off the Magnum P.I. aping with aplomb. Up close, it smacks more of a Magnum-era Rolex GMT Master II than it does its modern counterpart, which is very useful if you’re going for the full-on vintage look. At 40mm wide and 14mm thick, it is one of the chunkier watches on the wrist but it justifies these specs by boasting the automatic SII Caliber NH35A with a 41-hour power reserve and can go anywhere, with water resistance of 200 meters. For $99.99, it's hard to go wrong with this piece if you’re looking for a fun and famous name on a budget.</p>

                            <img src="https://cdn2.jomashop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/fde19e4197824625333be074956e7640/m/a/matheytissot-gmt-automatic-black-dial-pepsi-bezel-mens-watch-h903atar.jpg?width=546&height=546" width="110%" alt="Titanwatch">
                            <p>Now, this is another good option. The bezel colors are more muted and have good parallels for the original Rolex GMT Master II. Better still, the font used for the 24-hour time index on the bezel is an almost exact carbon copy. Add to that a pleasingly bright shade of red deployed on the GMT hand and you have an incredible visual corollary to Magnum’s famous ticker. A solid Jubilee bracelet (also in stainless steel) adds weight and a feeling of luxury to this heavily discounted option.

                                The price on Jomashop.com is just $269.99. That's a massive 46% off the recommended retail price of $499 and good savings for such a versatile and timeless watch.
                                
                                It's 42mm diameter and 10mm thickness indicates that the Mathey-Tissot Mathy Vintage GMT Black Dial Pepsi Bezel Men's Watch can be worn comfortably daily and its Swiss-made Ronda quartz caliber guarantees supreme accuracy and long battery life (of two years plus).</p>

                            <h3>#3. Tudor Back Bay Automatic Black Dial Men's GMT Pepsi Bezel Watch</h3>
                            <img src="https://www.jomashop.com/blog/content/images/2022/08/44.jpg" width="110%" alt="Titanwatch">
                            <p>The best budget version of the Rolex GMT Master II “Pepsi”, there can be no better candidate than the Tudor Black Bay GMT Pepsi. Why? Because it is the budget version of its bigger, badder, and more revered watch. The Tudor and Rolex companies are inextricably linked, and the brand’s histories run side-by-side. Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf’s goal with Tudor was to provide a working man’s Rolex at an accessible price. While that business model has experienced peaks and troughs in popularity, it still resonates today.

                                The great thing about Tudor is that you’re probably getting more for your money than you would with a Rolex. With Rolex, you cannot ignore the high premium attached to the name. And while the Rolex product is superior to the Tudor output, the difference is not as vast as the pricing structure would suggest.
                                
                                It means the Tudor Black Bay GMT Pepsi is worth every bit of its $3,950 price tag on Jomashop.com (that’s 5% below RRP). This 41mm wide reference M79830RB-0001 is, without a doubt, a modern classic and, to be honest, more likely to be the watch the real Thomas Magnum would choose if he were starting his private investigator practice today. He wasn’t a luxury-minded guy. His taste was so good that it influenced the rest of the world to follow him. In light of this, maybe you’d like to buck the trend and make your stamp on the classic Magnum look for:
